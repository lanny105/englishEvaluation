I like playing guitar, so my father buys me a guitar for fun. It is very funny. Then my mother asks me to have guitar class. She thinks to learn more skill is good for me. I start to have guitar class. It is really funny at first. But later on, I feel very tired. It is not easy to get improved. I want to give up, but I insist at last. Now I can pay several songs. I feel proud of it.
