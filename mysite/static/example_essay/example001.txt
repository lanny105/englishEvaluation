Today is Saturday, my father doesn't have to work, so I can enjoy the weekend with him, I feel so happy. My father and I decide to plant a small tree in our garden, so the garden will look more green. My father digs the hole, then I put the tree in the hole, we put the earth together. I think it is a meaning thing, I will see the tree grows up.
