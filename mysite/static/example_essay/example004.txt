Today, my mother took me to visit the China ASEAN Expo. It was amazing. There were lots of people. Some of them are not Chinese. My mother told me they were from other ten countries. It was my first time to see so many foreigners in the real life. Wow, there were many goods that I have never seen it before. Everything was fantastic for me. I won't forget this day forever.
