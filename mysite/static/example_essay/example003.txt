Look, this is a photo of my family. There are six people in the photo. The two people sitting in the middle with grey hair are my grandparents. My grandmother is three years older than my grandfather. They are all kind. The tallest one is my father standing behind my grandpa. My mother stands next to my father. My lovely younger sister stands close to my grandpa. And the one close to my grandma is me. I have a happy family. We love each other.
