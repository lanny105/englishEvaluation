My teachers and some elderly people often praise me. They always say that I must have a bright future, because I like study very much. I really like study. The knowledge from the book attracts me so much. Every time I search the knowledge there, I feel very satisfied, excited and powerful. I like exploiting all knowledge. I don't need anyone to push me to study. I just like it.
